# Multi-Tenant Job API with Laravel 12

## 🚀 Overview
This project is a multi-tenant job posting API built with Laravel 12.  
Each tenant (company) has its own database, and jobs are synced into Elasticsearch for fast searching.  
Queues (managed by Laravel Horizon + Redis) ensure heavy tasks don’t block requests.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Laravel 12 + Sail (Docker)
- MySQL (Central + Tenant DBs)
- Laravel Passport (Authentication)
- Redis + Horizon (Queue Management)
- Elasticsearch (Job search indexing)
